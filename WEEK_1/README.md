## Week One Practical Tasks

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### T1. Variables and Data Types:

Declare variables of different data types (int, double, boolean, String) to store the following information:

- Age of a person
- Height of a building
- Whether it's raining (true/false)
- Name of a city

### T2. Operators and Keywords:

Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input from the user and calculates their sum, difference, product, and division.

### T3. Java Control Statements:
Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a for loop.


### T4. Java If-else and Switch:
Write a program that takes the weekday number (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, ..., 7 for Sunday) as input from the user and prints the corresponding weekday name.


Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
